# Juno Stakedrop frontend

This is a shadow-cljs and reframe Javascript application. It is intended to be a simple frontend to display queried balances.

Balances will be put into LocalStorage to avoid multiple lookups.

## Development

### Getting started

Run the shadow-cljs watcher for the first time. Shadow is a build tool that bridges CLJ and Node, allowing for more seamless interop between the two platforms.

```sh
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

The first time, it will take a while to run.

When the build has finished, it will log the ports it is running on, and then something like:

    [:app] Build completed. (512 files, 0 compiled, 0 warnings, 25.08s)

When that happens, you can navigate to port 8080 in your browser and open the app.

There's also a shorthand in the NPM runner:

```sh
npm run dev:watch
```

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from your editor

See
[Shadow CLJS User's Guide: Editor Integration](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_editor_integration).
Note that `lein dev` runs `shadow-cljs watch` for you, and that this project's running build id is
`app`, or the keyword `:app` in a Clojure context.

Alternatively, search the web for info on connecting to a `shadow-cljs` ClojureScript browser REPL
from your editor and configuration.

For example, in Vim / Neovim with `fireplace.vim`
1. Open a `.cljs` file in the project to activate `fireplace.vim`
2. In normal mode, execute the `Piggieback` command with this project's running build id, `:app`:
    ```vim
    :Piggieback :app
    ```

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from a terminal

1. Connect to the `shadow-cljs` nREPL:
    ```sh
    lein repl :connect localhost:8777
    ```
    The REPL prompt, `shadow.user=>`, indicates that is a Clojure REPL, not ClojureScript.

2. In the REPL, switch the session to this project's running build id, `:app`:
    ```clj
    (shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :app)
    ```
    The REPL prompt changes to `cljs.user=>`, indicating that this is now a ClojureScript REPL.
3. See [`user.cljs`](dev/cljs/user.cljs) for symbols that are immediately accessible in the REPL
without needing to `require`.

### Running Tests

Build the app with the `prod` profile, start a temporary local web server, launch headless
Chrome/Chromium, run tests, and stop the web server:

```sh
lein karma
```

Please be patient; it may take over 15 seconds to see any output, and over 25 seconds to complete.

### Running `shadow-cljs` Actions

See a list of [`shadow-cljs CLI`](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_command_line)
actions:
```sh
lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli --help
```

Please be patient; it may take over 10 seconds to see any output. Also note that some actions shown
may not actually be supported, outputting "Unknown action." when run.

Run a shadow-cljs action on this project's build id (without the colon, just `app`):
```sh
lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli <action> app
```
### Debug Logging

The `debug?` variable in [`config.cljs`](src/cljs/juno/config.cljs) defaults to `true` in
[`dev`](#running-the-app) builds, and `false` in [`prod`](#production) builds.

Use `debug?` for logging or other tasks that should run only on `dev` builds:

```clj
(ns juno.example
  (:require [juno.config :as config])

(when config/debug?
  (println "This message will appear in the browser console only on dev builds."))
```

## Production

Make sure you have set the prod host in `events.cljs` - at some point this will be configured by env vars.

Build the app with the `prod` profile:

```sh
lein prod
```

Please be patient; it may take over 15 seconds to see any output, and over 30 seconds to complete.

The `resources/public/js/compiled` directory is created, containing the compiled `app.js` and
`manifest.edn` files.

The [`resources/public`](resources/public/) directory contains the complete, production web front
end of your app.

Always inspect the `resources/public/js/compiled` directory prior to deploying the app. Running any
`lein` alias in this project after `lein dev` will, at the very least, run `lein clean`, which
deletes this generated directory. Further, running `lein dev` will generate many, much larger
development versions of the files in this directory.
